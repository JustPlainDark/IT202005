## David Garcia
### I am a junior IT major who defines himself as a game dev. I 
### like a lot of stuff so if I were to talk about my interests it could 
### go for a while so some of the biggers ones are martial arts, games,
### Japanese culture and media and cooking. 
### This project was for IT202, Internet Applications, where we used  
### PHP, JS, HTML, SQL and CSS to create a web application. My end
### goal was to create an arcade website that could save scores and retain
### player score info. While the final project was incomplete, it gave good
### perspective on web development and using source control as well as 
### AGILE practices to maintain and organize a project. The final game
### while elementary is a stepping stone for me to do more serious game
### development projects for later classes.
